flamongo:
  - print summarised result
  - deal with index errors - e.g. names that are too long
  - check best index for multiple queries
  - change API so indexKeys dont need to be passed in
  - ensure that results aren't being skewed by previous queries, caches etc.
  - remove duplicate index drop
  - see if we need the NS error check
  - consider only printing the top 5 or 10 winners (could provide an opt for seeing all)
  - see if dropping indexes before stubbing data is faster
